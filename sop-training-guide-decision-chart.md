# SOP vs. training guide decision map

This decision map is a resource created during an organization's documentation redesign. The goal of this document is to help teams have a clearer idea of how to document new processes. One significant challenge this decision map solves from our needs analysis is providing a clear purpose and distinction between official standard operating procedures (SOPs) and onboarding-oriented support content such as training guides.
