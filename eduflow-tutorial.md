## Create a Course
1. Select **Create a course**
2. Give your course a title
3. Select **Add new** to create an activity or flow

     üìë **Note:** ‚ÄúActivities‚Äù are short, simple tasks. ‚ÄúFlows‚Äù have several built-in steps for exchanging teacher/peer feedback on assignments. 
     
     

4. In **Rules** tab, review activity guidelines and preferences

<br>

## Enroll students




There are two ways to get students onto your course roster: 



* Share a course link
* Email invites 
<br>

To send email invites in bulk, import a .csv file of your roster (names paired with emails)

    üçè Tip: You may invite others as co-teachers or teaching assistants when sending individual invites by email. 

<br>

### Link Invitation

1. Go to **Participants**
2. Copy the course URL link 
3. Share the link with students
<br><br>
### Email Group Invitations

1. Select **Invite participants ‚Üí Invite learners**
2. Go to ‚ÄúFile import‚Äù tab
3. Upload .csv file with student names and emails 
4. Select **Add learners**
<br>
<br>

Learn how to generate a .csv file: [steps](https://csvloader.com/csv-guide/how-to-create-a-csv-file), [video tutorial](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+generate+csv+file&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS960US960&oq=how+to+generate+csv+&aqs=chrome.0.0i512l3j69i57j0i512l6.11399j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:7dcd030d,vid:_c37nEV65Os)

<br>

 üìë **Note:** Once students confirm their enrollment in their email, their status will change from "pending" to "enrolled."

<br>
<br>

### Add or remove participants manually

1. Find students to add using the search bar on the **Participants** page.
2. Once you see the student‚Äôs name in the results, go to the individual settings for the student to add them.

<br>
<br>

## Customize activities and flows

Each activity or flow is customizable through its own settings. In these activity or flow-level settings, you will find general preferences within the **Rules** tab.  

Within **Rules**, you can manage permissions and assignment guidelines:


* **Visibility**: hiding or making your activity or flow viewable to students
<br>

* **Prerequisites**: selecting an activity that must be completed before 
* **Deadlines**: setting timeframes for submission deadlines
* **Locking**: preventing students from submitting past-due activities
* **Editing rights**: giving permission for students to edit their submissions
* **Assign to a subset**: choose which students should be assigned to the activity 

<br>
<br>

## Preview a course as a student



1. Find a student on the roster in **Participants**
2. Go to the individual settings for that student 
3. Select "log in as‚Äù 

    ‚úÖ You can view and navigate the course as the selected student.


 


    üìë **Note:** The Eduflow development team is working on a designated feature for instructors to switch to student view. See[ updates](https://eduflow.canny.io/).
<br>
<br>
## Evaluate Student Performance

There are three ways to score student performance for activities and flows: quantitative (grade percentage range), qualitative (converted into grade points on a scale), and completion. You can assign and adjust grading criteria for each activity or flow. The **Summary** tab allows you to view and track student performance data.
<br><br>

### Scoring for quantitative work 

Activities with quantitative performance measures like quizes will auto-calculate a percentage result for each student. Counting a quiz as a completion grade is also an option.

<br>


### Scoring for qualitative work
Student work that requires qualitative scoring will calculate based on a scale critera. 


    Example criteria:
    
    How effective was the student's use of evidence?
    
    100%    5 = Very effective (highly convincing and accurate evidence provided)

    75%     4 = Effective (fairly convincing and accurate evidence provided)

    50%     3 = Somewhat effective (some evidence provided)

    25%     2 = Not very effective (unrelated or barely evidence provided)

    0%      1 = Not effective (no evidence provided)


<br>
   
In an assigned flow, the score is an average between all evaluations at each step or item. For example, the final grade for a peer review flow would be the aggregate of all revewers' assigned scores.




<br>

### Scoring for completion

You can use compeletion scoring for activities based on participation only (like polls, videos, or discussions). You can set certain items in a flow to be scored for completion while others are evaluated qualitatively.
<br>
<br>

**For example:**

    Did the student cite their source? (Yes = 100% / No = 0%) 

<br>
Choose whether to include or exclude completion activities in a student‚Äôs overall score for the course (default will include them). Alternatively, determine how incomplete scores should be treated (ignored or marked as 0%). 


<br>

  üìë **Note:** Students need to click ‚ÄúMark as complete‚Äù for some activities to be considered complete. 


<br>
<br>

## Integrate virtual meetings

To add a virtual meeting, you will first need to generate a meeting invite link via Zoom, Google Meets, or Microsoft Teams. 



1. Select **Add new**
2. Scroll down to find **Embed & Integrations**
3. Choose the icon for your conferencing platform
4. Paste your meeting link 
5. Select the blue checkmark ‚òëÔ∏è "Finish editing‚Äù
